          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            Quentin Tarantino, born on March 27, 1963, is an Oscar-winning
            filmmaker famous for his distinctive use of violence, profanity, and
            extended monologues. His films often include pop culture references
            and feature recurring collaborators like Samuel L. Jackson.
            Tarantinoâ€™s storytelling is known for its nonlinear structure and
            memorable dialogue, which, combined with his unique approach to
            filmmaking, has made him one of the most influential directors in
            modern cinema.
